## Tools
The following tools were used in the project:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
  - [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
  - [React Native Easy Toast](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-easy-toast#api)
  - [Json Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

## Getting started

Before than started, you will need to install the following tools on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev). 
In addition it is essential to have a text editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

```bash
# clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/fbsoares-lu/app-gamer.git>

# Go to the project folder
$ cd app-gamer

# Install all dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the application on Expo
$ expo start
```

After that, choose your preference to emulate the app.<br/>

### Remember

To run the server you need to set the address of your machine in the cep file in the folder "services", like the image below;

</br>

also, change the package.json script to the address of your machine with the default port 3333, like the image below;

<br>

</br>


done that, just call the ```` yarn api```` command to run the server in another terminal window, because the other one will be running the project.
